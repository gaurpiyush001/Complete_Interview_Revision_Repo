arr[i]
compiler interprets the above line as -:
*(base_address(name_of_array) + index)

##NOTE##
When a pointer is incremented, it actually increments by the number equal to the size of the data type for which it is a pointer.

why array index start from zero????
In array, the index tells the distance from the starting element. So, the first element is at 0 distance from the starting element. So, that's why array start from 0.
