Every computer or device on the internet has two types of addresses: its physical address and its internet address. The physical address -- which is also called a media access control, or MAC, address -- identifies a device to other devices on the same local network. The internet address -- or IP address -- identifies the device globally. A network packet needs both addresses to get to its destination.

What is a MAC address?
Media access control refers to the piece of hardware that controls how data is pushed out onto a network.
A MAC address is responsible for local identification and an IP address for global identification. This is the primary difference between a MAC address and IP address, and it affects how they differ in their number of bits, address assignment and interactions. 

MAC address vs. IP address: What's the difference?
Both MAC addresses and IP addresses are meant to identify a network device, but in different ways. Some of the main differences between a MAC address and an IP address include the following:

#local identification vs. global identification;
#Layer 2 vs. Layer 3 operation;
#physical address vs. logical address;
#number of bits;
#address assignment and permanence; and
#address formatting.
