//Operator Overloading, When same operator is capable of performing different task's or action's
//for ex-: if multiply operator is capable of multiplying as well as adding

//-----NOTE------
//we cannot Overload every operator in cpp, Infact their is a list of operators which can be overloaded

//In OOPs, if we write "a*b"
//then, first Operand -> current Object on which operation has to be done
//second Operand -> Input
